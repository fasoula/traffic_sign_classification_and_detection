# Traffic Sign Classification
The folder 'traffic_sign_classification' contains a deep learning model (CNN) that classifies pictures of traffic signs. For this project I used the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark which can be found either on this [website](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) or on Kaggle. 
For the deployment of this model I build an app using streamlit. As a source for the app files I used this [repository](https://github.com/dD2405/Traffic_Sign_Classifier-with-Streamlit) and modified the code to suit my project.  

Remark: the app will be deployed soon also on github
